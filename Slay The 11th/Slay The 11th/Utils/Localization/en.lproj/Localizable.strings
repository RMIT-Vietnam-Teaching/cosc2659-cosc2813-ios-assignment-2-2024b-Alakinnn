In Slay The 11th, the player will have to fight their way from stage 1 to stage 11 and defeat the mighty boss at the end. During the gameplay, the player will find themselves with a unique set of cards, each with its own usage; some of which are unlocked when they reach a certain stage of the game. Moreover, players will find buffs as a reward of their choice in order to defeat the monsters in the dungeon.";

"debuff_mechanics_title" = "## Debuff Mechanics";
"debuff_mechanics_1" = "1. **Poison**: When poisoned, the enemies will take damage equal to the current duration they are being inflicted with at the end of the player turn. For example, during the player turn, enemy A has 4 stacks of poison, hence taking 4 damage at the end of the player turn. Poison decrements its duration after each player and enemy turn. Using the same example, after taking 4 damage, if the enemy is still alive, they will take 3 damage at the end of the next player turn unless they die. Poison will decrement until there are no stacks left.";
